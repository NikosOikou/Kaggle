The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-mobile-user-demographics/data?gender_age_test.csv.zip) provided by the competition is the following:

* gender_age_test.csv .zip (1.05 mb)
* app_labels.csv  .zip (4.04 mb)
* label_categories.csv    .zip (7.67 kb)
* phone_brand_device_model.csv    .zip (2.42 mb)
* sample_submission.csv   .zip (1.32 mb)
* events.csv  .zip (62.24 mb)
* app_events.csv  .zip (211.27 mb)
* gender_age_train.csv    .zip (891.47 kb)

Due to the total size of the unzipped files (around 1.17Gb), it is deemed unnessasary to add them to github.

The first exploration would be performed in the notebook.
